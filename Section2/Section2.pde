/*
Goal Processing formal lab:

1. Make a repo: 
MKS22X-ProcessingBasics
Use the Processing IDE to create and save 2 sketches.
When you save a sketch, it makes a folder with all the files inside of it. This is required, do not rename the folder.
Name them so I can tell which is which: 
e.g.
Section1
Section2

They will then be placed in your repo like this:
MKS22X-ProcessingBasics/Section1/Section1.pde
/*https://processing.org/tutorials/drawing/
Section 2 Fractals: (recursion is your friend here)
a) Sierpinski's Gasket
b) Koch Curve [CHALLENGE PROBLEM! Try it but don't worry if you get stuck]*/
